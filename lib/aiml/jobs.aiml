            In a typical day, I would analyze a software bug, respond to a 
            request about how the software works from a Quality Assurance 
            (QA) engineer, design a feature or software enhancement, 
            write unit tests, implement a feature (write code).  
            Itâ€™s rare to do all of these on the same day, 
            but I spend some time on each of these things every month.

            Our team works with React, Node, and some internal tools.
            A typical day usually consists of working on 1 medium task 
            and maybe 1-2 smaller ones. I work on a solution and then spend 
            time making sure it is a solid one by trying to break it and 
            catch any edge cases. I submit the changes for review with my 
            team and if it is good I can merge it into the source code 
            otherwise I get feedback and iterate on the changes. 
            Other days are more planning with meetings to work out the next
            tasks and new features for the upcoming sprint.

            Read more to find out what you're interested in. Start listening 
            to podcasts about data science. Come up with projects you're
            excited about and create a portfolio/github sooner rather than 
            later. Familiarize yourself with source control 
            (lol I still suck at git)

            My projects are typically long term, so I can usually focus on 
            one thing at a time. I start with a lot of time focused on 
            research and planning followed by data collection and 
            manipulation before I actually start any 
            building/training/programming. I also juggle my main 
            job with business analytics requests, and learning to balance 
            ad hoc work and my primary responsibilities took time.
